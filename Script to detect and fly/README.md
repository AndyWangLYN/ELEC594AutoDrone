Both of these scripts are implemented using a Mission class from the skymission.mission module, which is a subclass of grpc.server, and uses a DroneController class from the skyengine.drone module to control the drone. The start_mission method is to be the main entry point for the mission, and it takes a list of waypoints as input and makes the drone fly to them in sequence. The start_location_log method logs the drone's location to a log file using a DirectLogger from the skylog.logger module.

The idea of this design is to allow the drone to first fly a default route to detect flowers (in this case, a straight line for 6 meters in total.) and then it also allows the user to manually input the location of the target(s) so that it will also fly to assigned locations.

Both of these scripts are implemented using a Mission class from the skymission.mission module, which is a subclass of grpc.server, and uses a DroneController class from the skyengine.drone module to control the drone. The start_mission method appears to be the main entry point for the mission, and it takes a list of waypoints as input and makes the drone fly to them in sequence. The start_location_log method logs the drone's location to a log file using a DirectLogger from the skylog.logger module.
